            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, saut√© the ground beef. Add the garlic and onion and continue cooking until the meat is browned and the onions have softened. Pour in the tomato sauce and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in a large pot and drain them with a colander before they reach al dente.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the parsley and salt. Place the bowl in the fridge until it's time to assemble the lasagna.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
                <li>In a deep 9x13 pan, begin assembling the lasagna by placing a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Cover this layer with noodles before topping with the ricotta cheese followed by a layer of sliced mozzarella. Cover this layer with meat sauce then top with the Parmesan cheese. Repeat this process 2 more times.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Optional: broil with the foil removed for an additional 2 minutes to brown the cheese before serving.</li>
